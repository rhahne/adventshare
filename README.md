## Description

Imagine this following scenario:
You are very keen to go for a climbing trip for a week at the beginning of April. Unfortunately all your friends either don't have time are no climbers. Sucks, right?
This is why we came up with Adventshare. A Platform where you can choose one of our unique apartments and get assigned with like-minded people for the ideal outdoor trip. You will share the appartment with 2-10 other solo-travellers for a week in one of our beautiful areas.

## Features

- Search for the perfect appartment based on your personal preferences
- Search by your favourite outdoor area
- Search by your kind of outdoor activity
- Get a selection of houses in the best outdoor areas.

## How to book a place?

 1) Sign up / Log in to the Website
 2) Choose the house of your dreams
 3) Show Interest in a housing:
 Based on the calendar on the right side, you can show interest in a specific week. (Don't worry, you will not get charged yet). 
 4) Wait unti all spots in your desired week are filled.
 5) As soon as all spots in a week are filled, you will get a notification in your profile, which you have to confirm. During this confirmation you will have to pay your part to the apartment and you will have the ability to meet your travel-buddies.
 6) Prepare for your trip! :D
